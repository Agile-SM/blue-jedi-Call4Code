# Solution

Blue Jedi is an IBM Cloud services based solution, for the prevention of natural disasters thanks to: 

  - Watson Image Recognition
  - Watson Machine Learning
  - Watson IoT
  - ESRI ArcGIS
  - Cloudant DB
  - SDK for Node.JS

### IBM Cloud Services

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins. Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| IBM Cloud Service | Information |
| ------ | ------ |
| Watson Image Recognition | Quickly and accurately tag, classify and train visual content using machine learning. |
| Watson Machine Learning | Deploy self-learning models into production at scale. |
| Watson IoT | The IBM® Watson™ IoT Platform solution provides a set of IBM Cloud services as a single IBM-managed SaaS offering that enables you to collect and analyze relevant product performance and usage datafor your IoT enabled assets. |
| ESRI ArcGIS | Bring the power of location to your apps with ArcGIS – a complete geospatial platform for developers. |
| Cloudant DB | Cloudant is an IBM software product, which is primarily delivered as a cloud-based service. Cloudant is a non-relational, distributed database service of the same name.  |
| SDK for Node.JS | Develop, deploy, and scale server-side JavaScript® apps with ease on IBM Cloud Foundry. The IBM SDK for Node.js™ provides enhanced performance. |

### Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd blue-jedi-Call4Code
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

# Disclaimer
We are simulating random data for the IoT sensors (with maximun/minimun levels), so the prediction is not real and could be differences between satellite image prediction and the Machine Learning prediction for IoT sensors data.

  - Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
  - Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)
